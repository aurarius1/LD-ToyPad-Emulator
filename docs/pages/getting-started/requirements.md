# What hardware do you want to use?

First you need to decide what hardware you want LD Toypad Emulator to run on. There are two supported options:

1. Using a virtual machine.
   Since there are no special requirements you can directly go to [vm install](/usage/installation.html#amd64--virtual-machine)
2. Using a Single-Board Computer (like a Raspberry Pi). See [sbc requirements](#sbc-requirements)

## SBC Requirements

This guide will assume that you are using a suitable Raspberry Pi.

- Your SBC must be configurable as an USB gadget.
  :::details
  For the Raspberry Pi family suitable models are either the Zero (W), the Zero 2 (W), the Pi 4 or the Pi 5.
  :::

- A Micro SD Card (8GB+, although [raspberrypi.com](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html#recommended-sd-cards) recommends at least 16GB for the Lite version of Raspberry Pi OS)

- Internet connection on your PC and single board computer

Now you can go to [sbc install](/usage/installation.html#sbc)
